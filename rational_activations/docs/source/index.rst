================================================
Welcome to Rational Activations's documentation!
================================================

.. highlight:: python

Rational Activations provided in this package are learnable rational activation
function to create rational neural networks.
So far, only the pytorch and MXNET implementation are available.

Requirements:
#############
This project depends on:

- pytorch
- numpy, scipy (if you want to add different initially approximated functions)
- matplotlib (if you want to use the plotting properties)
- torchvision (if you want to convert a torchvision model architecture to Rational)

Download and install:
You can download from the
`Github <https://github.com/ml-research/activation_functions>`_ repository or:

::

    pip3 install rational-activations
